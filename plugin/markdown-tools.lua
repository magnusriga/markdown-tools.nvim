-- Entry point for plugin/ directory loading.
-- This ensures the setup function is available but doesn't run it automatically.
-- Users should call require("markdown-shortcuts").setup() in their config.

-- If you want the plugin to load automatically without explicit setup,
-- you could call setup here, but it's generally better practice
-- to let users control when setup runs.
-- require("markdown-shortcuts").setup()
